## Uploading Jupyter Notebooks to Jovian

```eval_rst

Jovian allows you to upload and share <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target=_blank> Jupyter Notebook</a> instantly with a single command, directly within Jupyter. Make sure you've completed the [installation](install.md) before reading further.

#### Uploading Notebooks

**Step 1**: Import `jovian` by running the following command within a Jupyter notebook.

```
import jovian
```

**Step 2**: After writing some code, running some experiments, training some models and plotting some charts, you can save and commit your Jupyter notebook.

```
jovian.commit()
```

When you run `jovian.commit` for the first time you'll be asked to provide an API key, which you can get from your <a href="https://jovian.ai?utm_source=docs" target=_blank> Jovian </a> (or Jovian Pro) account.

Here's what `jovian.commit` does:

- It saves and uploads the Jupyter notebook to your <a href="https://jovian.ai?utm_source=docs" target=_blank> Jovian </a> (or Jovian Pro) account.
- It captures and uploads the python virtual environment containing the list of libraries required to run your notebook.
- It returns a link that you can use to view and share your notebook with friends or colleagues.

For more features of `jovian.commit` and API reference visit [Commit](../api-reference/commit.md).

```eval_rst
.. attention::
        In certain environments like JupyterLab and password protected notebooks, ``jovian`` may not be able to detect the notebook filename automatically. In such cases, pass the notebook's name as the ``nb_filename`` argument to ``jovian.commit``.
```

#### Import notebooks from URL

Create a `New Notebook` imported from any hosted URL which points to a .ipynb file (Github/Gitlab/....)

#### Benefits of Jovian

**Easy sharing and collaboration**: Just copy the link to share an uploaded notebook with your friends or colleages. Your notebooks are also visible on your profile page, unless you mark them _Secret_. You can also add collaborators and let others contribute to your project ([learn more](collaborate.md)).

**Cell-level comments and discussions**: Jovian's powerful commenting interface allows your team to discuss specific parts of a notebook with cell-level comment threads. Just hover over a cell and click the _Comment_ button. You'll receive an email when someone comments on your notebook, or replies to your comment.

**End-to-end reproducibility**:
Jovian automatically captures Python libraries used in your notebook, so anyone (including you) can reproduce your work on any computer with a single command: `jovian clone`. You can also use the 'Run' dropdown on the Jovian notebook page to run your notebooks on free cloud GPU platforms like Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels and BinderHub.
