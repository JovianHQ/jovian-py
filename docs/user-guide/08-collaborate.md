## Collaborating on Jovian projects

<a href="https://jovian.ml?utm_source=docs" target=_blank> Jovian.ml </a> allows you to add collaborators to work with you on a ML Project.

### How to add collaborators?

Click on `Share` button of the notebook and add them by their username or email id registered with <a href="https://jovian.ml?utm_source=docs" target=_blank> Jovian.ml </a> (you can add a non jovian user email id as well to send an invite).

This will allow the contributors to be able to [commit](02-upload.md) changes to the same notebook project. The experiments by all the collaborators will also show up in the [compare table](07-compare.md). tab.

### Comment on individual code cells

Users can comment on any code cells individually and maintain that thread to have specific discussion about a part of the source code with context.

### Maintain public, secret and private notebooks

You can find the option to `Public`, `Secret` and `Private` in the settings for each notebook.

- **Public** : These notebooks are visible on your profile and accessible to all.
- **Secret** : These notebooks are hidden from the profile but anyone with the link can access the notebook.
- **Private** : These notebooks are only accessible to the owner and collaborators.
