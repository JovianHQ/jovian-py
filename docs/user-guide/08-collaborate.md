## Collaborating on Jovian projects

### How to add collaborators?

Click on `Share` button of the notebook and add them by their username or email id registered with Jovian.

Now even they can [commit](02-upload.md) changes to the same notebook project. Can compare the experiments by all the collaborators in the [compare table](07-compare.md).

### Comment on individual code cells

Users can comment on any code cells individually and maintain that thread to have specific discussion about a part of the source code with context.

### Maintain secret notebooks

You can find the option to `Make Secret` in the settings for each notebook. So, it remains among the collaborators and the users with link to that notebook.
