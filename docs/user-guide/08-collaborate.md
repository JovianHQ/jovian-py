## Collaborating on Jovian projects

Jovian allows you to add collaborators to work with you on a ML Project. 

### How to add collaborators?

Click on `Share` button of the notebook and add them by their username or email id registered with Jovian.

This will allow the contributors to be able to [commit](02-upload.md) changes to the same notebook project. The experiments by all the collaborators will also show up in the [compare table](07-compare.md). tab.

### Comment on individual code cells

Users can comment on any code cells individually and maintain that thread to have specific discussion about a part of the source code with context.

### Maintain secret notebooks

You may set a notebook as secret to hide it from publically being displayed on your profile. Only collaborators and users having the link to the notebook will be able to view it. 
You can find the option to `Make Secret` in the settings for each notebook.
