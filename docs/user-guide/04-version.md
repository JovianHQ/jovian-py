## Notebook versioning and diffs

### Version control

If you're used to creating many duplicate versions of notebooks with slight modifications and long file names. Look no further Jovian will be your version control for notebooks.

`jovian.commit` records all the versions under same notebook project. So, each change can be a version by author and collaborators which can be easily toggled between.
