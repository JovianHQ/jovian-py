## Notebook versioning and diffs

### Version control

If you're used to creating many duplicate versions of notebooks with slight modifications and long file names. Look no further, Jovian will be your version control for notebooks.

`jovian.commit` records all the versions under same notebook project. So, each change can be a version by author and collaborators which can be easily toggled in the [website](https://jvn.io).

<!-- **TODO-SB: GIF for committing version, version part of the ui screen shot** -->

```eval_rst
.. note:: You have to own the notebook or have to be a collaborator to commit changes to the same project notebook. If not you can commit any changes made to your profile as a new notebook.
```

### View Differences

All the versions are comparable, you can view additions, deletions made among any 2 versions of the notebook. Hide/show common part of the code.

**How to view the differences?**

1. [Commit](../jvn/commit) different version and visit [Jovian](https://www.jvn.io).
2. Click on `Version` drop down on the right top corner.
3. CLick on `Compare Versions`
4. Select any 2 versions with the use of check boxes and click on `View Diff` button.

<!-- **TODO-SB: GIF for visiting compare versions and viewing diff of two versions and also the functionality to show or hide common part of the code.** -->

There are more things to be compared, but first let's add more content to the notebook to understand all the parameters that can be compared. Click on `Next` to follow through.
