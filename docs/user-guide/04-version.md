## Notebook versioning and diffs

### Version control

If you're used to creating many duplicate versions of notebooks with slight modifications and long file names. Look no further, <a href="https://jovian.ml?utm_source=docs" target=_blank> Jovian.ml </a> will be your version control for notebooks.

`jovian.commit` records all the versions under same notebook project. So, each change can be a version by author and collaborators which can be easily toggled in the <a href="https://jovian.ml?utm_source=docs" target=_blank> website </a>

```eval_rst
.. note:: You have to own the notebook or have to be a collaborator to commit changes to the same project notebook. If not you can commit any changes made to your profile as a new notebook.
```

### View Differences

All the versions are comparable, you can view additions, deletions made among any 2 versions of the notebook and also hide/show common part of the code.

**How to view the differences?**

1. [Commit](../jvn/commit) different versions and visit <a href="https://jovian.ml?utm_source=docs" target=_blank> Jovian.ml </a>.
2. Click on `Version` drop down on the right top corner.
3. Click on `Compare Versions`
4. Select any 2 versions with the use of check boxes and click on `View Diff` button.
