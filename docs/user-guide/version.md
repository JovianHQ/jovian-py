## Notebook versioning and diffs

```eval_rst
.. meta::
   :description: Version control for Data Science experiments with Jupyter notebooks using Jovian.
```

### Version control

If you're used to creating many duplicate versions of notebooks with slight modifications and long file names. Look no further, <a href="https://jovian.ai?utm_source=docs" target=_blank> Jovian </a> will be your version control for notebooks.

`jovian.commit` records all the versions under same notebook project. So, each change can be a version by author and collaborators which can be easily toggled in the <a href="https://jovian.ai?utm_source=docs" target=_blank> website </a>

```eval_rst
.. note:: You have to own the notebook or have to be a collaborator to commit changes to the same project notebook. If not you can commit any changes made to your profile as a new notebook.
```

### View Differences

All the versions are comparable, you can view additions, deletions made among any 2 versions of the notebook and also hide/show common part of the code.

**How to view the differences?**

1. [Commit](../api-reference/commit) different versions and visit <a href="https://jovian.ai?utm_source=docs" target=_blank> Jovian </a>.
2. Click on `Version` drop down on the right top corner.
3. Click on `Compare Versions`
4. Select any 2 versions with the use of check boxes and click on `View Diff` button.

There are more things to be compared, but first let's add more content to the notebook to understand all the parameters that can be compared. Click on `Next` to follow through.
