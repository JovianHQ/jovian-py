## Comparing and Analyzing experiments

Having minimum of 2 versions of a notebook will enable you to use `Compare Versions` present in the `Version` dropdown on the top right corner.

Here you can observe all types of information about all of your versions.

- All the parameters logged under dataset.
- All the parameters logged under hyperparameters.
- All the parameters logged under metrics.
- Notes (for author and collaborators add extra notes)
