**Services**

The Company is in the business of, inter alia, providing an online Software as a Service (SaaS) Platform for sharing and collaborating on data science projects, wherein users can create an Account to upload their projects on the Platform for sharing publicly or privately, comment on other users’ reproduced work. We also provide on-premise and private cloud deployment of Services for enterprises. Other users visiting a user’s profile can view all public projects created by the user. A user can also see his/ her own private and secret projects. Apart from projects, the public profile also shows an activity feed or timeline, which lists all the public actions the user has performed on the platform, including but not limited to creating, updating, editing or deleting projects, etc.

A project uploaded to the Platform can consist of many things: datasets, source code, graphs, analysis of data, input & output files like CSVs, images etc. Projects created on the Platform have one owner, but they can have multiple collaborators. The creator can add collaborators via email or by providing their Platform username. Users can also create teams on the Platform. Each user shall always remain liable for any content uploaded by him/ her.

The Platform provides a small installable module in the form of an open-source python library (https://github.com/JovianML/jovian-py) that users are required install on their own computers in order to analyze data, train models, plot graphs, etc. When the python library is invoked in the code, it picks up all the relevant information like code, dataset, development dependencies, etc. and uploads them to the user’s Account. A user is required to provide an API key from their Account, which is stored on their computer to uniquely identify them on that computer and associate their work with their Account.

Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, which includes sharing the profile details and sending direct messages to the other Users. We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Platform and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice. Information and content that You share or post may be seen by other Users on the Platform. We have made certain privacy settings available to all Users and we will honour the choices You make about who can see your content or information. However, it is advisable that the Users use such privacy settings in a manner which suits their preferences while using the Platform. There are 3 privacy options for projects: public, secret and private. Public projects are visible on a user’s profile, where they can be seen by other people, show up in Google search results, and can be featured on promotional emails and/or blog posts sent by Jovian. Anyone on the internet may access a user’s public projects. Private projects are those for which the creator has to explicitly grant access to other users of the Platform, for them to be able to see & modify the project. Access is granted by entering the Jovian username or registered email. Secret projects are hidden from a user’s profile, and are not indexable by search engines. The user can share the link of a secret project with others, and they can then view the secret project.

You can repost content from App elsewhere, provided that you attribute the content back to the App and respect the rights of the original poster, including any “not for reproduction” designation. Further, You may enable another online service provider, such as a social networking service such as Google, YouTube, Slack, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, blogging sites, etc. (“Integrated Service Provider”), to be directly integrated into your account on the Application. By enabling an integrated service, You are allowing us to pass to, and receive from, the Integrated Service Provider your log-in information and other Content.
