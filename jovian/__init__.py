    """Save the notebook, capture environment and upload to the cloud for sharing.

    In most cases, commit works well with the default arguments. It attempts to 
    1. Save the Jupyter notebook
    2. Upload the notebook (and additional scripts, CSVs etc.) to https://jvn.io 
    3. Capture the python environment (using Anaconda or pip)
    4. Upload the python environment to cloud

    Capturing the python environment ensures that the notebook can be reproduced and 
    executed easily using the `jovian` command line tool. For more details, see 
    https://jvn.io/getting-started . 

    Issues and bugs can be reported here: https://github.com/swiftace-ai/jovian-py

    Arguments:

        secret (bool, optional): Create a secret notebook on https://jvn.io , which is only 
            accessible via the link, and is not visible on the owner's public profile. By default,
            commited notebooks are public and visible on the owner's profile.

        nb_filename (string, optional): The filename of the jupyter notebook (including 
            the .ipynb extension). This is detected automatically in most cases, but in
            certain environments like Jupyter Lab, the detection may fail and the filename
            needs to be provided using this argument.

        files (array, optional): Any additional scripts (.py files), CSVs that are required to
            run the notebook. These will be available in the files tab on https://jvn.io .

        capture_env (bool, optional): If `True`, the Python environment (python version,
            libraries etc.) are captured and uploaded along with the notebook.

        env_type (string, optional): The type of environment to be captured. Allowed options are
            'conda' and 'pip'.

        notebook_id (string, optional): If you wish to update an existing notebook owned by you,
            you can use this argument to provide the base64 ID (present in the URL) of an notebook 
            hosted on https://jvn.io . In most cases, this argument is not required, and the library
            can automatically infer whether you are looking to update an existing notebook or create
            a new one.

        create_new (bool, optional): If set to True, doesn't update the existing notebook on 
            https://jvn.io (if one is detected). Instead, it creates a new notebook when commit is called.
